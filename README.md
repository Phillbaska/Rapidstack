# Rapid Stack: A Modern UI Layer for Claris FileMaker

**Rapid Stack** is a low-code UI builder/layer designed specifically for use within Claris FileMaker. Build entire interfaces within a single Web Viewer, or create hybrid systems using traditional FileMaker layouts.

---

### üöÄ Born from Necessity  
Created out of frustration with traditional FileMaker UI limitations.

### üé® Modern Interface Design  
Bringing contemporary web design principles to the FileMaker ecosystem.

### üõ† Developer Empowerment  
Enabling FileMaker developers to build beautiful, standardized interfaces without extensive knowledge of web coding.

### ü§ù End-User Experience  
Delivering intuitive, responsive applications that meet modern expectations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

### Early Development Stage  
Both the Rapid Stack builder and its web code are currently in active development. These components are **not yet stable for production use**. Expect breaking changes in later versions.

### Optimisation Pending  
Code has not yet been fully optimised or thoroughly tested. Performance may vary and unexpected behaviours could occur.

### Surprise Features  
You may encounter bugs ‚Äî or as I optimistically call them, *"surprise features"* ‚Äî whilst using the current build.

üëâ **I appreciate your understanding as I work to refine Rapid Stack. Any feedback during this development phase will be invaluable for improving the final product.**
